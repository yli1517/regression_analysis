    "The purpose of this analysis is to figure out whether women-led and minority-led entrepreneurs' need more support for their business. The dataset we used for analysis came from the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs (ASE) of US Census. The variables that we focused on included two dependent variables: annual payroll and number of paid employees; and two independent variables gender and race.\n",

    "However, these results might be largely limited due to the following reasons: 1) we only performed one-way ANOVA by using one dependent variable and one independent variable to test the group mean differences; 2) data is only limited to the year of 2014; 3) the inclusion criterion for the dataset only limited to top 50 metropolitan areas and nonfarm business, so that business in suburban or rural areas and farm related business are not included. Therefore the generalization of these finds to other populations or areas is not applicable. "
